Made an awesome test page to practice with Eloquent Javascript and Fun Fun Functions Youtube videos!

This was a tough practice, working around some ECMAScript6 higher-order functions

Higher-order functions as .filter, .map, .reduce are used into a JSON file provided by @MarijnJH in Eloquent Javascript e-book manual.
The JSON file contains all the creator's ancestries names, date, and parents information (that's why the name of the files, ancestry*.js)

The buttons placed in the HTML are for testing the second part of it. The private/public factory functions, explained by @mpjme in his
Youtube's video tutorials. (this one in particular - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImwrezYhw4w)
